🚗 Car Sales Analysis Project (SQL + Python)

This project focuses on analyzing a Car Prices / Car Sales dataset using MySQL and Python.
It explores revenue trends, category-wise performance, customer insights, and product behaviour using SQL queries visualized in Jupyter Notebook.

✅ Project Overview

This analysis aims to uncover:

Best-selling car categories

Revenue contribution of each segment

Price trends and distribution

Customer behavior

Factors influencing car prices

Monthly/Yearly sales patterns

Insights for dealerships and business decision-making

The project uses a cleaned car_prices dataset and executes SQL queries inside Jupyter Notebook for professional reporting.
